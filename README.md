## Hello! I'm Doom.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Spew, a Domain-Specific Language for installing files and applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, HTML and CSS.
- 👯 I’m willing to collaborate on projects related to games and cyphers, which are my interests.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been experimenting with Linux since I was 8 years old.
- ⚡ Other fun fact: Fork commits do not count towards the contribution calendar (I've lost my streak because of it)
